## Installation

Several scripts are set up in the root package.json to manage distribution build and running the app as follows:
* start: node server/server.js,
* develop: concurrently \cd server && npm run watch\ \cd client && npm start\,
* install: cd server && npm i && cd ../client && npm i,
* seed: cd server && npm run seed,
* build: cd client && npm run build

Running install will install all the required client and server dependancies. This is a React web app.

The seeding data will create the following MongoDB documents:
* Required config data
* A default scenario and stakingPlan
* A user - John Smith username: johnsmith password: password
* API settings record ready to enter betfair details into

Note: Two env vars are required to hold secret for authorisation and mongo database link (if running in the db in Mongo Atlas or elsewhere)
* JWT_SECRET
* MONGODB_URI

### File structure of the application:
```md
.
├── client/public          // contains public standard folders and files with default base html page
├── client/src             // contains src standard folders and files with the addition of React pages and components folders
├── client/src/utils       // contains the Auth for JWT Decode and Apollo/graphQL queries and mutations
├── server/classes         // contains two classes to control the Betfair API and logic.
├── server/utils           // contains additional logic helper files for the app
├── server/seeders         // contains seed files to get started
├── .gitignore             // indicates which folders and files Git should ignore 
├── LICENCE                // licence file      
```
Note: The root, client and server folders each have seperate package.json files that setup required app and dev dependencies.

NOTE: There is a scheduler.js file in the Server/Utils that uses a setInterval timer to automatically request data from the Betfair API. These automatted proceses do the following:
* Event update every 4 hours
* API keepalive every hour
* PlaceBets every 15 seconds
* Bet update every 15 seconds (alternate to placebets-offset by 7 sedonds)

The following mongoDb database schemas are used:
* Apisettings - holds the Betfair API settings and status data
* Condfig - holds global system config values
* Event - holds all system event data
* EventTypes - a list of current Betfair event types
* Market - holds all the market data for each event
* Result - holds all bet and bet result data
* Runner - holds all the market runner data
* Scenario - holds the template scenarios data
* Staking Plan - holds the template staking plan data
* System - holds all sytem configuration and statistical data
* Transaction - all account/wallet transactions
* User
